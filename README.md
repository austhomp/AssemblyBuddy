Assembly Buddy
=============

Updates assemblies from class library projects to other projects that use them.

Motivation
----------

When you need to customize a library and build it locally it can be annoying to copy the output to the target projects repeatedly after every change.
Batch files can work but are brittle.

Usage
----------

Not quite that far along yet...
